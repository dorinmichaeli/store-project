# Notes

## Firebase

1. Created a new Firebase project called "college-project" with an id of `college-project-7ea81`.
2. Opted out of Google Analytics when creating the project, we have no use for that in a project used for learning.
3. Add Firebase to your web app.
4. Added "Google Account" as an authentication method.
